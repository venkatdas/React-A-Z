# Javascript Notes

## Pure function

- In JavaScript, when a function does not mutate objects but just returns a new object, itâ€™s called a pure function.
- OR
- A function, or a method, in order to be called pure should not cause side effects and should return the same output when called multiple times with the same input.
- A pure function takes an input and returns an output without changing the input nor anything else.
- Its output is only determined by the arguments. You could call this function 1M times, and given the same set of arguments, the output will always be the same.
- React applies this concept to components. A React component is a pure component when its output is only dependant on its props.
- All functional components are pure components:
``` Javascript
const Button = props => {
  return <button>{props.message}</button>
}
```
