# Advanced topics of React


## How we setup Vite with React
- ```npm create vite@latest my-vue-app -- --template vue```
- Instead of vue replace it with react like
- ```npm create vite@latest my-react-app -- --template react ```
After that
- ```npm install```
- ```npm run dev```

## What is React Hooks?
- React Hooks are simple JavaScript functions that we can use to isolate the reusable part from a functional component. Hooks can be stateful and can manage side-effects.
